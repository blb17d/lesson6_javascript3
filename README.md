### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. Browser Object Model (BOM) creates a hiearchy of objects and each of these objects provide program access to different parts of a webserver.
2. Document Object Model shows an example of application programming interface. It contains all of the elements of a web page. Javascript elements are represented by their own objects.
3. Learning about opening and closing web windows. When a new browser is opened, a new window object is created and represents the new window.  Someone may open a new browser because to launch a new web page or to use a new window to view additional information.
